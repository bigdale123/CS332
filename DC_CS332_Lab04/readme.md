# Build commands
    You must build the program before running it. To do this, run `make`.
    If you want to run gdb on the program, run `make debug`.
# Running the Program
    To run the program, use the following syntax:
        `./lab4 <base_file> <extra_file>`
        Where:
         - <base_file> is replaced with the name of the file to append to
         - <extra_file> is replaced with the name of the file that has the text to append to <base_file>
